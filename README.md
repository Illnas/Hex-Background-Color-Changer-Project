Hex Background Color Changer Project

Second project out of them hundred! Similar project to the one I did previously, where I changed background color (I used rgb there) and here not 
did I need to use hex color codes but also make sure to show that hex color code on screen whenever I click button. It did take some time 
but I have finished it! 

Let's go onward to conquer next project!!!
